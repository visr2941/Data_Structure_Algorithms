 Problem:
    Find the closest number y with same weight as x in terms of bit count such that
    |y - x| is minimum.
 
 Solution:
    Swap the first two LSB non-matching consecutive bits.
 
 Explaination:
    To keep the number of set bits same and have a new number closest to the original,
    we will have to swap one 0 to one 1. We must start with LSB as flipping LSB should
    give the minimum change in the number. Let's say we swap two non-matching bits of x
    at position k1 and k2 producing x1. The |x-x1| will be |2^k1 - 2^k2| and to minimize
    it k1 should be as close as k2 and k1 should be minimum.
